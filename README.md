# Project Description
We are working on a website to build a puzzle game using quantum circuits, quantum gates, quantum hardware theoritical knowledge to make players learn quantum computing and some general information about quantum mechanice. Players are given access to IBM Quantum simulators to solve the puzzle questions as they reach to the hard and moderate level of the game where are needed to code and run programmes. Till now, we have been able to make a website prototype version of the game. 



# Submission | Hack Solution üìù

To solve our hack problem of making an interactive ‚Äúprogram‚Äù, we have to build a game website where a player has to solve given problems to solve the puzzles to win the game. 
First, we have sign-in and sign-up options so that players can have their data secured in the google account with which they have signed in. Then, they are given three levels of the game, Beginner, Moderate and Hard levels. 
In the first level called Beginner, the user will have to solve a set of questions to solve puzzle having almost 10 pieces and each piece will have simple questions related to quantum circuits, quantum gates and some theoretical quantum hardware related questions which have been created from the qiskit notebook. For the moderate level, the user is then asked to solve more challenging questions to solve puzzle consisting over more pieces like 15 to 25 and more difficult questions about quantum computing, coding, and building big quantum circuits using IBM Quantum Simulators will be used to make the moderate level of the game. After these two levels, we have our final Hard level, for which we can level up the questions to make it face off human vs quantum computer by using quantum machine learning and advanced qiskit material to solve puzzle pieces which will be in the range of 50 to 100 pieces in a puzzle problem.
